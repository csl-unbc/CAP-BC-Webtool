Land-facet diversity represents the variety of land-facet types, which are landscape areas classified according to landform, elevation, HLI, and soil order. Higher values indicate a greater nearby variety of land facets (combinations of elevation, HLI, landforms, and soil orders).</p><p><em>Value Interpretation:</em></p><p>Higher values indicate a greater nearby variety of land facets (combinations of elevation, HLI, landforms, and soil orders).</p><p><em>Reference:</em></p><p>Carroll, C., T.
