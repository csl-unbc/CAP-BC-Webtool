As forests grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it as biomass (trunks, branches, roots and leaves) and in soils. Net primary productivity is widely used as an indicator of the rate at which an ecosystem accumulates this biomass. This layer is the annual Net Primary Productivity mean in the period 2000 to 2013.</p><p><em>Reference:</em></p><p>Zhao, M., Heinsch, F. A., Nemani, R. R., & Running, S. W. (2005).
