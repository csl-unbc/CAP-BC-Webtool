Potential species’ movements between areas of historical climates and their 2080s climate analogs under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The dataset was produced with a connectivity model based on electrical circuit theory and considers climate analogs, landscape permeability, and species dispersal capacities (Cartwright, J. M., 2020).</p><p><em>Value Interpretation:</em></p><p>High values indicate important movement routes for species to track changing climate conditions, with human modification largely determining the underlying permeability of the landscape and thus which parts of the landscape species may traverse. Low values indicate areas that may be relatively less important for climate-induced movements. (Cartwright, J. M., 2020).</p><p><em>Reference:</em></p><p>Littlefield, C. E., C. Carroll, B. H.
