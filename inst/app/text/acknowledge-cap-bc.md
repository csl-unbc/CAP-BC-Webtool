This project, in partnership with [Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions](https://pics.uvic.ca), [The Nature Trust](https://www.naturetrust.bc.ca/), [Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society](https://cpaws.org/) and [BC Parks Foundation](https://bcparksfoundation.ca/), and also by [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/) and [UNBC](https://www.unbc.ca/) universities.

CAP-BC uses as a conservation planning application a specific implementation of [Where to work](https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/) tool, special thanks to them. The Where To Work application was developed by Jeffrey Hanson, Jaimie Vincent, and Joe Bennett at Carleton University and Richard Schuster at the Nature Conservancy of Canada. The work by Carleton University was completed under contract with the Nature Conservancy of Canada. This work was supported by generous contributions by Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Royal Bank of Canada.
