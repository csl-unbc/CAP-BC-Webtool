CAP-BC provides a means of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change, thereby ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient as possible moving forward and provide a tool to our partners that promotes the development of a network of protected areas in BC that is adaptive to future climate change</p>

                    projected to diversify and intensify over this century, which poses an unprecedented threat to our
                    socio-economic systems and natural environment. There is an urgent need for solutions-
                    focused research on how to adapt business-as-usual practices to minimize our vulnerability to
                    such risks, particularly as they affect biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and ‘at risk’
                    Species.</p>

                    <p>The core question we address in partnership with The Nature Trust, Canadian Parks and Wilderness
                    Society and BC Parks Foundation is:</p>

                    <p>CAP-BC, as a flexible systematic conservation planning tool, can provide a set of outcomes to
                        support decisions of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change,
                        thereby ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient as possible moving forward.</p>

                    <p>The tool is flexible to set different targets to the major conservation approaches (see Framework),
                        set weights or hard constraint with some specific layers. This flexibility of the tool provide for
                        diverse user groups a set of options to generate conservation solutions from a climate change
                        perspective based on their needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>This tool will be flexible for diverse user groups, preloaded with data, and updatable for future
                        advances in BC climate change knowledge.
