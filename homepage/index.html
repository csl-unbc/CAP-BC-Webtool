                        provide climate–adapted systematic conservation planning to partnerships, government, NGO, private
                        institutions and individuals in BC. CAP-BC provides a means of adapting our conservation plans to
                        the projected impacts of climate change, thereby ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient
                        as possible moving forward and providing a tool to our partners that promote the development of a
                        network of protected areas in BC that is adaptive to future climate change</p>

                    <h2>Why?</h2>
                    <p>The impacts of climate change are already being felt in British Columbia [1, 2]. These impacts are
                    projected to diversify and intensify over this century, which poses an unprecedented threat to our
                    socio-economic systems and natural environment [3, 4]. There is an urgent need for solutions-
                    focused research on how to adapt business-as-usual practices to minimize our vulnerability to
                    such risks, particularly as they affect biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and ‘at risk’
                    Species.
                    </p>

                    <p>We address in partnership with The Nature Trust, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and BC
                        Parks Foundatio, the core question of the project:</p>

                    <h2>Objectives</h2>
                    <p>CAP-BC is a flexible systematic conservation planning web-tool, can provide a set of outcomes to
                        support decisions of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change,
                        thereby ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient as possible moving forward.</p>

                    <p>The web-tool is ready-to-use, preloaded with data and grouped into six major conservation approaches
                        focused on climate change (see Framework) with an additional group for ecosystem services. The
                        web-tool gives users the flexibility to set particular targets for groups or for each layer,
                        lock-in or weighting with specific layers, giving to them the flexibility to generate conservation
                        solutions from a climate change perspective based on their needs.

                    <h2>Framework</h2>
                    <p>The Yale framework [5] identifies six major adaptation objectives for biodiversity conservation
                        and climate adaptation across two broad approaches. The first approach is to strengthen current
                        conservation efforts through the objectives of 1) protecting current patterns of biodiversity,
                        2) protecting large, intact, natural landscapes and ecological processes and 3) protecting the
                        geophysical setting. The second broad approach is to anticipate and respond to future conditions
                        through the objectives of 4) identifying and appropriately managing areas that will provide future
                        climate space for species expected to be displaced by climate change, 5) identifying and protecting
                        climate refugia, and 6) maintain and restore ecological connectivity.</p>

                    <p>We carefully selected the data based on the framework but also we prepared and adjusted them to
                        the planning unit and for the web-tool. We define two planning units with different resolutions:
                        1km and 5km. Fine resolution (1km) is better and closer to the actual data and features, and also
                        for the results (we recommend it), however it takes more time to load and process. Coarse
                        resolution (5 km) works faster than fine resolution and provides to users with a quick exploration of layers and solutions. </p>

          <p style="float:left;">The idea of the project Climate Adaptive Planning for British Columbia (CAP-BC) is develop an online, open-access webtool to provide climate–adapted systematic conservation planning across BC. CAP-BC will provide a means of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change, thereby ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient as possible moving forward and provide a tool to our partners that promotes the development of a network of protected areas in BC that is adaptive to future climate change</p>
