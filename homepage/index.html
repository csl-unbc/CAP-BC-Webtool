                        institutions and individuals in BC. CAP-BC provides a means of adapting our conservation plans to

                        as possible moving forward and providing a tool to our partners that promote the development of a
                        network of protected areas in BC that is adaptive to future climate change</p>

                    <p>The impacts of climate change are already being felt in British Columbia [1, 2]. These impacts are
                    projected to diversify and intensify over this century, which poses an unprecedented threat to our
                    socio-economic systems and natural environment [3, 4]. There is an urgent need for solutions-
                    focused research on how to adapt business-as-usual practices to minimize our vulnerability to
                    such risks, particularly as they affect biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services, and ‘at risk’
                    Species.

                    <p>We address in partnership with The Nature Trust, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and BC

                        support decisions of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change,

                    <p>The web-tool is ready-to-use, preloaded with data and grouped into six major conservation approaches
                        focused on climate change (see Framework) with an additional group for ecosystem services, cost
                        and constraint layers. The web-tool gives users the flexibility to set particular targets for
                        groups or for each layer, lock-in or weighting with specific layers, giving to them the
                        flexibility to generate conservation solutions from a climate change perspective based on their needs.

                    <p>Nowadays there are many conservation strategies in addition to the approaches that include climate
                        change adaptations, most of them with different ways for conservation and biodiversity management
                        [7], this variety of strategies tends to cause confusion and difficulty
                        for decision-makers to determining if they are complementary, competing, or contradictory options
                        in conservation planning [6].
                    </p><p>
                        Yale Framework was created with the idea to understand, organize and structure the different
                        conservation strategies into major objectives, providing coherence for planning and conservation
                        actions to integrate climate change adaptation strategies into the context of natural resource
                        planning and policymaking [6].</p>

                    <p>The first three approaches are the classic conservation strategies that most of the approaches
                        have used and currently use: (1) Protect current patterns of biodiversity, (2) Protect large,
                        intact, natural landscapes and ecological processes and (3) Protect the geophysical setting.
                    </p><p>
                        These approaches are very important because they keep all essential elements
                        need for species and biodiversity. For instance, well-managed protected areas reduce rates of
                        habitat loss, maintain species population levels and can provide crucial ecosystem services
                        [8], and preserve areas with diversity or high complex geophysical settings
                        are crucial to conserve ecological and evolutionary processes and protect species associated with
                        these features [9]. But also these classic conservation strategies help as a
                        basis for the other three Yale strategies that are adapted to the projected climate [6].

                    <p>The others three approaches address climate futures: (4) Identify and manage areas that will
                        provide future climate space, (5) Identify and protect climate refugia and (6) Maintain and
                        restore ecological connectivity.
                    </p><p>
                        These (4-6) Yale approaches address climate futures and require climate change
                        scenarios analyses to explore the influence on species distributions and ecosystem functions and
                        services. These conservation strategies are important because are not only
                        about protecting what we have now, but also for future. For instance, many species and their
                        habitats may respond to changing climate by generating changes in their geographical ranges;
                        to preserve these species, we need to protect future climate space which can help anticipate
                        future migration and locations for them [10]. Also, Heller and Zavaleta [7] found
                        that increase connectivity is the best recommendation in their study about several conservation
                        planning that have integrated climate change, additionally, increment and guarantee connectivity
                        across different landscapes fosters the ability of species to move, migrate and shift their pattern.

                    <p>We carefully selected the data based on the six major adaptation objectives from the Yale framework
                        but also we included another special group called ecosystem services, and costs and constraints
                        layers to calibrate the solutions based on user needs. All the data were prepared and adjusted to
                        the planning unit, which is the minimum geophysical space for planning. We define two planning
                        units with different resolutions: 1km and 5km. Fine resolution (1km) is better and closer to the
                        actual data and features, and also for the results (we recommend it), however it takes more time
                        to load and process. Coarse resolution (5 km) works faster than fine resolution and provides to
                        users with a quick exploration of layers and solutions. </p>
