# CAP-BC Climate Adaptive Planning for British Columbia

Our objective is to make climate-informed systematic conservation planning accessible not only to our Solution Partners
for immediate application in their work, but to all government, NGO (Non Governmental Organization) and private
institutions and individuals in BC. This will be a tangible and lasting product from this project that will essentially
democratize conservation planning in the province, allowing it to remain accessible and flexible for diverse user
groups, as well as updatable with future enhancements to our understanding of climate change in BC

* CAP-BC will provide a means of adapting our conservation plans to the projected impacts of climate change, thereby
  ensuring that our protected lands are as resilient as possible moving forward

* Provide a tool to our partners that promotes the development of a network of protected areas in BC that is adaptive
  to future climate change

To create a user-friendly interface for developing conservation scenarios, we customized and developed our
implementation to align with our specific requirements using the [Where to Work](https://ncc-cnc.github.io/wheretowork/)
tool as a foundation. Where to Work is a web-based application for solving complex conservation scenarios using 
concepts of systematic conservation planning. It was developed by Jeffrey Hanson, Jaimie Vincent, and Joe Bennet at 
Carleton University and Richard Shuster at the Nature Conservancy of Canada.
